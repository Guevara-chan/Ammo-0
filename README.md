# ⋮Sum⋮
__Ammo:0__ is an experimental top-down 2D anti shooter, designed to explore and refine basic concepts of subgenre.  
_How will you fight when all your ammunition is out ?_ - this game totally revolves around that simple question.  
Initially made in ~3 days using [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/phaser3), project is focused on code expressiveness and rapid development.

# ⋮Featuræ⋮
* Zero ammunition.
* Lots of enemy rockets.
* Infinite pacifistic carnage.
* Omnicontrol scheme: mouse ? Sticks ? WASD ? Arrows ? D-Pad ? All variants was covered.

# ⋮Compatibility⋮
__Ammo:0__ was best tested with _Chrome 76_ and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), which is used to develop it.  
🐞 _Mozilla Firefox_: works with some particle animation problems and overall lesser framerate.  
🐞 _Edge_: got problems with some UI elements and serious lags.  
🐞 Mobile _Chrome_: works except minor UI disambiguations.  
_No __iOs__ support was achieved so far._
